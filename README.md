GenAI & LangChain Foundations Platform
A comprehensive platform demonstrating core GenAI and LangChain fundamentals through practical implementations of RAG systems, conversational agents, and multi-model integrations.

🚀 Features
RAG-powered Conversational Agents - Semantic document retrieval with context-aware responses

Multi-Agent Architecture - Coordinated AI workflows for complex task handling

Vector Database Integration - Efficient similarity search and document embedding

Multi-LLM Support - OpenAI, Groq, and open-source model compatibility

Persistent Memory - Conversation history and context management

RESTful API - FastAPI endpoints for scalable deployment
